Theme: Delivery

Boss rush, but you're the boss

Select character (1 / 3) (Izzy, Norman, Howard) (move speed, cooldowns, primary attack range, skin)

CHARACTER:
Character abilities = primary attack 1s, tripple attack 5s 1/10%, dodge 3s
dodge = roll animation + speedx3

( x3attack - quips "letter delivery", "christams chards", "birthiday cards", "death chain", "hate mail")

( character quips for: entering stage, getting hit, "close calls", boss 2nd stage, victory, defeat, mistake moves)

(mistake move quips: "Mom! I can't right now, I'm playing!", " *brbr* *click* hello?, I can't talk right now"
	"Kittens! Get off my keyboard!", "")
	
Everytime the boss loses it's health bar, the character does a "mistake", dash/roll towards boss

Character keeps to the middle with a little offset away from the boss ( depends on the current hp bar state, gets
	closer the lower the health bar -+20%) and walks from side to side
	
( pickups for the character to increase damage, predictable movement towards the power-up)

BOSS:	
Boss has several health bars x10

Boss has a move pattern: Circular AOE, Line AOE, Melee AOE
2s cd between each attack, attacks build up "fatigue" which degrades over time, reaching max puts the boss
	in a stun state where he can't act and takes double damage as it drains over 5s.
	
attacks have a 2s "red warning zone" before doing damage/animation

(the boss has 4 places between which me moves randomly)

2nd stage after reaching half boss health (bars)
	half the animation/ indication time, double damage
	(another ability added to the pattern)
	
(3 bosses, each stronger then the first)
	
BEATING THE GAME:
max fatigue to speed up 1st stage, get to health bar end to bait a mistake for a melee attack
2nd stage bait dodge with first ability into second ability radius
